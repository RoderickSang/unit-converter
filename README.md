You can see and use this website here: http://rodericksang.com/unit-converter/

This is a finished Scrimba solo project on making a website to convert different units of measure.

The constraints of the project are met, which were to create a website following [this design shown on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AdqUVRQCZGP1zRcEvzmJTm/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0%3A13) with flexibility to use our own gradient colors. We were to use just vanilla javascript, no frameworks.

As a stretch goal I made the website fully functional by allowing for user input.
